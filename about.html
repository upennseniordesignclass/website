            <em>In Search Of</em>, the first Senior Design Exhibition at the University of Pennsylvania brings together our interdisciplinary studies throughout the past four years as part of the new Design major. In this exhibition, some students reflect on memory, considering our culture and heritage, the communities, music, foods, and objects that have become a part of who we are, through explorations across augmented and virtual reality, website design, and fabrication. Playful practices of documentation and speculation allow others to critically examine contemporary technologies, from social media to surveillance tools, and to consider their place within our lives. Handmade publications and a lighting installation engage viewers to interact with them, and other works concern the urban environment and ponder ways in which we can promote sustainability.
            <br /><br />
            We've always been filled with questions, continuously searching for something â€” from coming up with a fresh idea that will guide a project to forming new friendships, and perhaps most significantly this year, we also think about what lies ahead for us, beyond these walls in Addams and the campus streets we have become so familiar with. In Search Of captures our endeavors to find the things we each care about, through fifteen projects we are excited to present and hope can in turn spark new questions and conversations.
